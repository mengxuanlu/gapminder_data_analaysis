# gapminder_data_analaysis

## Project Overview

The dataset I am using is Gapminder from http://www.gapminder.org/data/. I chose four features, which are children per woman, child mortality between zero and five year old, life expectancy and income. In order to be consistent, I use data from year 1800 to year 2018. What I am interested to see is the trend for these features during the past few centuries. And whether child's mortality is related to the other three features. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

I am interested with the following topic from the data, and did exploratory analysis to better understand the data: <br />
1) Women fertility rate  
2) Children mortality rate 
3) Life expectancy 
4) Individual Income
5) Total child per woman vs. children motality rate
6) Income and Life Expectancy vs. Child Mortality
7) Does certain region have different patterns for the above features?
